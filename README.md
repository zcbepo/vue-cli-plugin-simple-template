## vue-cli-plugin-simple-template

vue-cli-plugin-simple-template is a template plugin for most applications of my work. It is made to increase my working efficiency.

It is based on [vue](https://cn.vuejs.org/index.html), and I referenced [vue-element-admin](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin/)

Usage:
```
    vue create my-app
    // don't select vuex & vueRouter

    cd my-app
    vue add simple-template
```
